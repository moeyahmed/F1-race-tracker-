## üõ† Tools and Development

This project was built around React and the [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) library. The goal of this project was to improve my skills in working with RESTful API's as well as explore a different method of fetching data with the react-router loaders. I also constantly get lost trying to find F1 race times so this is something I actually have a use for.

### ‚òï API

This project was initially supposed to work around the [Ergast Developer API](http://ergast.com/mrd/) which sends up-to-date F1 race and standing data. Most of the data and listings come from this API, however, I was still missing key information and elements.

Since I display the flags for each driver in multiple places around the site, I created `CountriesContext.js` which allows me to get the flags and nationalities of any driver using their demonyms (Ergast API only returned the demonym of each driver, such as "Dutch" or "German"). Since I would have to loop through each country to retrieve country data from the demonyms, I opted to using a context as that information would only have to be loaded through once per page.

For the specific driver and contructor page, the Ergast API also lacked some more detailed information that I would of liked to display. Such as the number of career points, total wins, grand prix's entered, etc. The only source I was able to find to retrieve this data was through wikipedia. Using the[ MediaWiki Action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), I constructed a hook which retrieved the infobox data (the rectangle on the right side of wikipedia articles) from any wikipedia page based on the title in the infobox.

To fetch this data, I used react-router's new v6 loaders. As explained [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/loader): "As the user navigates around the app, the loaders for the next matching branch of routes will be called in parallel and their data made available to components through useLoaderData". This made it extremely easy to handle data loading and handle transitions as well as errors.
